NFT Marketplace

üìñ Overview
A decentralized NFT marketplace built on Ethereum that allows users to list, buy, cancel, and update NFT listings. The platform uses smart contracts to enable secure peer-to-peer transactions where sellers maintain ownership of their NFTs until sold, with proceeds safely held for withdrawal.
‚ú® Features

List NFTs for Sale: Users can list their NFTs on the marketplace while retaining ownership until sold
Buy NFTs: Purchase listed NFTs directly with cryptocurrency
Cancel Listings: Sellers can remove their NFT from the marketplace at any time
Update Listings: Change the price of your listed NFTs
Withdraw Proceeds: Safely withdraw funds from your sales
Subgraph Integration: Real-time data updates via GraphQL
